# eeg-hypnosis-complexity

_A pilot open-data analysis project exploring consciousness and complexity._

## Overview

This project analyzes EEG data collected during guided imagery hypnotherapy (LIGHT dataset) to explore brain signal complexity across altered states of consciousness. Complexity is measured using metrics such as Lempel-Ziv Complexity, Sample Entropy, and others.

The goal is to understand how different phases of hypnotherapy influence brain dynamics and how these might relate to shifts in conscious experience.
